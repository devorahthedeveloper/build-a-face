Major Features: 
- when deleting a face, user gets a modal asking "are you sure you want to delete?"
- split out saveLabel and saveFeature into separate methods so user can save each independently
- user can export a face via url for sharing
- user can import a previously-exported face
- user can create their own values for a featureSet (custom)

Other:
- clean up code/folder structure as per John Papas style guide
- explore using underscore's unique id generator


DONE:
- test that deleting a face doesn't break localstorage conventions
- ability to select "none" for a featureSet
- if there are no saved faces, add text "You currently have no saved faces"
- user can delete a previously-saved face
- user can edit the name of a previously-saved face
- combine new.html and edit.html into a single template
